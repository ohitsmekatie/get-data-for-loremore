# Data Scripts

üëã This repository contains scripts for collecting data from various sources to populate the database for my website [Lore & More](https://ohitsmetables.com/), which is a resource for world building and TTRPG game prep.


## Overview

The repository includes scripts to:

1. Extract first names from local text files (CSV format)

### First Name Generator (`generate_first_names_json.py`)

**Data Source**: The script processes files from the SSA's published dataset of most popular baby names by year. These files are stored in `.txt` format with comma-separated values.

**Process**:
- Reads all `.txt` files from a configurable source directory (`/Users/katie.sipos/Desktop/names/`)
- Extracts the first column from each line, which contains the first name
- Deduplicates names (using a set data structure)
- Sorts names alphabetically
- Exports the unique names as a JSON array to `data/first_names.json`

**Key Features**:
- Error handling for file access issues
- Progress and status reporting in terminal
- UTF-8 encoding support for international names
- Type hints for better code readability and IDE support

**Example Usage**:
```bash
python generate_first_names_json.py
# ‚úÖ Extracted 18,452 names to data/first_names.json
```

The output file is used in a random name generator for the Lore & More website.


2. Scrape last names from [one-name.org](https://one-name.org/surnames_a-z/)

### Last Name Generator (`generate_last_names_json.py`)

**Data Source**: The script scrapes surname data from the [one-name.org](https://one-name.org/surnames_a-z/) website, which contains a comprehensive list of surnames organized alphabetically.

**Process**:
- Iterates through each letter of the alphabet
- Makes HTTP requests to pages for each letter (e.g., `?initial=a`, `?initial=b`, etc.)
- Parses the HTML response using BeautifulSoup to extract surname text from table cells
- Filters to only include pure alphabetical names (no special characters)
- Deduplicates and sorts the extracted surnames
- Exports the unique surnames as a JSON array to `data/last_names.json`

**Key Features**:
- Polite web scraping with 1-second delay between requests
- Network error handling with timeout protection
- Progress indicators showing names found per letter
- Type hints for better code readability

**Example Usage**:
```bash
python generate_last_names_json.py

# üîç Scraping letter a...
# ‚Üí Found 2,547 new names for a
# ...
# ‚úÖ Extracted 15,873 surnames to data/last_names.json
```

The output file is used alongside first names in the random name generator.

These are just manual scripts to run locally for now, but my plan is to automate these in some way to be used directory from the Lore & More site.

## Setup and Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Local directory with first name data files (for `generate_first_names_json.py`). This can be anything! It's just hardcoded for my own local directory right now

### Dependencies

- Required Python packages:
  - `requests` - For making HTTP requests to web sources
  - `beautifulsoup4` - For parsing HTML content


## Data Sources

### First Names
- **Source**: Social Security Administration (SSA) baby name data
- **Format**: Text files with comma-separated values
- **Location**: Local directory (`/Users/katie.sipos/Desktop/names/`)
- **Content**: Each file contains yearly records of popular baby names
- **Output**: `data/first_names.json` - Alphabetically sorted array of unique names

### Last Names
- **Source**: [one-name.org/surnames_a-z/](https://one-name.org/surnames_a-z/)
- **Format**: Web-based data scraped from HTML tables
- **Content**: Comprehensive list of surnames organized alphabetically
- **Output**: `data/last_names.json` - Alphabetically sorted array of unique surnames

## Usage in Lore & More

These name datasets are used to power random character generators and other world-building tools on the [Lore & More](https://ohitsmetables.com/) website. The JSON format makes it easy to integrate with web applications and database imports.
